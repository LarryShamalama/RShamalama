## RShamalama

This is a repository to help me learn about creating `R` packages and deploying them on GitHub.


#### Installation

To install the latest version of `RShamalama`, you are welcome to run the following script in your Terminal:

```
#install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github(larryshamalama/RShamalama)
#I'm trying to make this change
```

#Kristin is making a bunch of comments
I can now make changes without a conflict b/c I pulled it first.
